    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p> This documents contains some observations and pitfalls encountered 
      when using different drivers and databases. Of course this list is not complete.
      Also some of these problems might have vanished in the mean time. </p>
    <h4> driver-connect </h4>
    Using driver-connect one does not have to create an ODBC datasource for every 
    database one wants to use. The necessary parameters for the driver manager/driver 
    are supplied via connection string. 
    Some connection strings examples for using driver-connect
    <ul>
      <li> using the excel driver "DRIVER={Microsoft Excel Driver (*.xls)};
        DBQ=C:/TEMP/Book1.xls"
      <li> using the access driver:
        "Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};DBQ=c:/temp/Copy of OMR TT Reports.mdb"
      <li> using an Oracle Driver "DRIVER=Oracle in oracl92;UID=SCOTT;PWD=tiger;server=ltrav1"
    </ul>
    One way to get a connection string is to create a file dsn and have a look at its contants, 
    note that userid and password are encrypted in this file,
    
    
    <h4>Problems using the Jet driver on windows</h4>
    It seems that the jet driver needs to have write access to the registry directory 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC,
    see <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q295297> 
      PRB: Error Message: 0x80004005: General Error Unable to Open Registry Key
    </a>.
    In the mentioned document these steps are recommended
    <ul>
      <li>1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe). 
      <li>2. Select the following key in the registry:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC  
      <li>3. On the Security menu, click Permissions. 
      <li>4. Type the required permissions for the account that is accessing the Web page. 
      <li>5. Quit Registry Editor 
    </ul>
    <h4> driver-connect, another approach</h4>
    It seems that windows creates a temporary dsn if you try to connect via driver 
    connect and if use the key DRIVER=????.  If security is high on the computer this
    will fail. Another option is to create for each kind of datasource a default 
    datasource with the correct driver. 
    
    
    <h4> performance </h4>
    It seems that with clisp storing and retrieving C datatypes from memory take a lot time.
    This should be possible without consing, maybe I have to change my clisp FFC module.
    
    <h4> access </h4>
    For character parameters Access requires that the columnsize argument 
    is set to a value smaller than 255. Oracle and sql server do not care.
    It sems that the columns size parameter must depend on the driver.

    <h4>lobs and oracle</h4>
    There is a problem with stored procedures with lob parameters.
    If the actual parameter is longer than 32513, then an error occurs:
<pre>
[Oracle][ODBC][Ora]ORA-01460: Nicht implementierte oder sinnlose Umwandlung gefordert
, error code 1460, State: 37000.
</pre>
    When doing an insert,update there is no problem.
    I have found he following in V$SQL:<br>
    <tt>insert into test (id,text) values(23* :1,:2) RETURNING "TEXT" INTO :TEXT</tt>
<br>

    <h4>line end and oracle</h4>
    Oracle has problems with ascii(13) (or ^M) in create procedure statements 
    (I supect this is the holds for all PL/SQL statements). They are accpeted in SQL 
    statements. It seems that CLISP replaces this character on Windows with chr(10). 
    Allegro does not do this. Therefore some code that runs fine with CLISP
    causes an error on with Allegro.
<pre>

(("X")) ;

</pre>

<h4>MYODBC and unicode</h4>
MYODBC (3.51?) does not return unicode character data as datatype SQL_WVARCHAR. If for SQL_VARCHAR data the return datatype is set to SQLWCHAR, the length in the indicator is 0. It seems that the buffer is also empty (= #x000000000 ...). There is some talk about better support for unicode in another version (3.52?).

<h4>

<h4>Oracle 9.2 and unicode</h4>
<p>
I can not make Oracle return unicode. I am using a 9.2 DB I have created a nchar column which is a 
unicode datatype for 9.2.
<p>
I am using the oracle driver. There is a workaround tab where one can force the driver to 
return string data as SQL_WCHAR.
Storing unicode strings with parameters of type :unicode-string inserts some dummy character (a '?' standing on its head). Selecting nchr(1000) returns the same charcater.<br>
Only selecting from  NLS_SESSION_PARAMETERS returns a 16bit charcater.
Or do I have this problem since NLS_CHARACTERSET=WE8ISO8859P15?
<h4> Oracle 10gR2 and unicode</h4>
It works now (with Oracle driver!):
<pre>
[13]> (schar (caar (exec-query *con* "select nCHR(232) from dual")) 0)

#\LATIN_SMALL_LETTER_E_WITH_GRAVE
[14]> 

[16]> (char-code (schar (caar (exec-query *con* "select ? from dual"  (list (string (code-char 1234)) :unicode-string))  ) 0))

1234
</pre>


<h4>Microsoft ODBC driver for Oracle</h4>
Currently it does not work on my computer. I get the error message:
<pre>*** - [Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle][Oracle], error code 0, State: NA000.
</pre>
Visual Studio 6.0 has the same problem. Is 9.2 supported by Microsoft ODBC-Driver?

<h4>Oracle and ref cursors</h4>
This works with 9.2 and 10g and 10gR2. Make sure that the ODBC datasource is 
configured correctly. On the "Oracle ODBC Driver Configuration" window check the
checkbox with label "Enable Result Sets".<br>
Example:
<pre>
create or replace package test99_pkg as        
  type refcursor is ref cursor;       
  procedure test_cursor(v varchar2,c in out refcursor);      
end;

create or replace package body test99_pkg as       
  procedure test_cursor(v varchar2,c in out refcursor) is
  begin         
    open c for select v as a,'1234567890' as b from dual; 
  end;      
end;
</pre>

The cursor can be retrieved with following lisp code:
<pre>
(with-prepared-statement (stm con 
                                "{call test99_pkg.test_cursor(?,?)}" 
                                '(:string :in ))
    (let ((str "just a string"))
      (exec-prepared-query stm str)))
</pre>
Note that the cursor parameter must be declared in/out. 
If a parameter ist supplied for the cursor parameter, it still works. 
</em>
<em>This needs more investigations.</em>

<h4>Oracle TIMESTAMP datatype</h4>
<h5> 9.2, 10g</h4>
Windows: For the Oracle-Driver, queries on TIMESTAMP columns return SQL_NULL_TYPE. Normally this would be retrieved
as String. But the program coredumps at the first fetch.
The Microsoft driver coredumps earlier, namely when the sqlexec is executed.<br>
Columns of type SQL_NULL_TYPE cause an error, the offending column has to be removed from the query.
At least we prevent the coredump of the Oracle driver.<br>
I am pretty sure that this is a driver bug, Microsoft Access coredumps as well in similar situations.
<h5>10g R2</h5>
It works now, a timestamp column is retrieved as SQL_TIMESTAMP.
Of course the sub second precision is not supported.

<h4>MySQL</h4>
This is not one would expect!
<pre>
MySQL> create view bla as select  date_add('2007-8-1',interval 1 day) as a;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

MySQL> desc bla
    -> ;
+-------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| a     | varbinary(29) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
how to do it right:
<pre>
MySQL> create view bla2 as select  date_add(cast('2007-8-1' as datetime),interval 1 day) as a;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MySQL&gt; desc bla2;
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type     | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| a     | datetime | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-------+----------+------+-----+---------+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>
Be carefull with variables, declared with something like 
<tt>set @a =1</tt>. The types are automatically determined, and a type for
dates does not exist.
</p>
<p>
Of course error handling in MySQL is not existent, maybe I should change the
server settings:
<pre>
MySQL> select cast(cast('12345678901' as decimal) as char) as a, cast(cast('1234567890' as decimal) as char) as b;
+------------+------------+
| a          | b          |
+------------+------------+
| 9999999999 | 1234567890 |
+------------+------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>So there is no overflow error.</p>
<p>
Division by zero is handled, but only for an insert:
<pre>
MySQL> set @a=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MySQL> set @b=0;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

MySQL> select @a/@b;
+-------+
| @a/@b |
+-------+
|  NULL |
+-------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

MySQL> insert into blu select @a/@b;
ERROR 1365 (22012): Division by 0
</pre>

<h5>Handling of numbers</h5>
<pre>
[130]> (exec-query *con* "select cast(1.5e0/3.9e0 as char(200)) as a")

(("0.38461538461538")) ;
("a")
[131]> (exec-query *con* "select cast(cast(1.5e0/3.9e0 as decimal(40,20)) as char(200)) as a")

(("0.38461538461538460000")) ;
("a") 
</pre>
In clisp on x86 I get:
<pre>
[132]> (/ 1.5d0 3.9d0)

0.38461538461538464d0
</pre>
With sql server I get the same value, as with clisp.
<p>
And another example :
<pre>
MySQL> select 1e14/7e0,1e14/7e0-14285714285714;
+----------------+-------------------------+
| 1e14/7e0       | 1e14/7e0-14285714285714 |
+----------------+-------------------------+
| 14285714285714 |              0.28515625 |
+----------------+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
The decimal expansion of 1/7 is periodic, so the digits 0.285 are correct. Thus
MySQL uses the precision of double, but does not return all digits.
<p>

<h3>The SQL Parser</h3>
The <tt>/* ..*/</tt> comments do not have to be closed:
<pre>
19]> (exec-query *con3* "select 1 as a /*bla")

((1)) ;
("a")
</pre>
Maybe this depends on the version of MySQL or some system parameter.
</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
As mentioned in the documentation, MySQL does not support out and in/out 
parameters for sql statements. As the documentation of MySQL suggest 
one should declare variables, pass them as parameters to the stored 
procedures. After the procedure call one get there contents with a select 
statement, example: <tt>select @param1 as param1,@param2 as param2</tt>.

</p>
<p>
The problem with variables on MySQL is that one can only set them. It is
not possible to declare a datatype for them.
Another option is to select the parameters directly in the stored procedure. 
Thus instead of having out or in/out parameters, the procedure returns
return values as a result set. Note that <tt>exec-query</tt> accepts parameters 
and can return more than one result set. One example, assume 
<tt>*con*</tt> is a MySQL connection.
<pre>
[33]>  (exec-command *con* "
    create procedure test99(a1 varchar(200),b1 int,c1 date) 
    begin
    declare a2 varchar(200);
    declare b2 int;
    declare c2 date;
     set a2=concat(a1,'x');
      set b2=b1+3;
      set c2=c1+ interval 1 day;
      select a2 as a2,b2 as b2, c2 as c2;
    end;")


[34]> (exec-query *con* "call test99(?,?,?)" "abc" 
                          (list 12 :integer) (list  (encode-universal-time 12 3 5 12 11 2007) :date))

(("abcx" 15 3403897200)) ;
("a2" "b2" "c2")
[35]> 
</pre>
<h4> PostgreSQL </h4>
<a href=http://sql-info.de/postgresql/postgres-gotchas.html>
http://sql-info.de/postgresql/postgres-gotchas.html
</a>
<h5>BLOBS </h5>
It seems that lobs are not supported.
When executing an update with a BLOB I get:
<pre>
*** - 
      ERROR: type "lo" does not exist;
      Error while executing the query, error code 7, State: 42704.
</pre>
According to the documentation one has to run lo.sql from the contrib section. 
Blobs Columns have to be declared as of type <tt>lo</tt>.
<h5> SQL Parser</h5>
The parser is buggy.
<pre>
<![CDATA[
[76]> (plain-odbc:exec-query *con* "select 'a' as a,? as b " 1213)

(("a" 1213)) ;
("a" "b")
[77]> (plain-odbc:exec-query *con* "select 'a' as a,/* comment */ ? as b " 1213)

(("a" 1213)) ;
("a" "b")
[78]> (plain-odbc:exec-query *con* "select 'a' as a,/* comment ? */ ? as b " 1213)

*** - The # of binded parameters < the # of parameter markers, error code 32, State: 07002.
The following restarts are available:
ABORT          :R1      Abort main loop
Break 1 [79]> 

[80]> (plain-odbc:exec-query *con* "select 'a' as a,/* comment '?' */ ? as b " 1213)

(("a" 1213)) ;
("a" "b")

]]>
</pre>
Maybe this the ODBC driver and not the database itself.


<h5> PostgreSQL, 8.3</h5>
Creating a function like
<pre>
create function test99 ( a in integer ) returns void as $$
    begin 
    insert into testtab99 (a) values(a+1);
    end; 
   $$ language plpgsql;
</pre>
gives an error. PG Sql does not like that the name of the column is the
same as the name of the parameter. This is a well known feature.
<h5> Out Parameters </h5>
Out parameter will be returned as out parameters. But a function with 
out parameters must have as a return type record and the return values are
returned as a result set with just one row.

<h4>Sqlite</h4>
<p>
The following depends as usual very much on the ODBC driver. This driver is not written
by the people who wrote Sqlite.
</p>
<p>
Computed String columns are returnd as <tt>$SQL_VARCHAR</tt> of size 255.
Of course this is not enough in many cases and data is truncated. 
And the indicated size for the value in a specific row can be larger
than 255.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
<![CDATA[
[58]> (trace plain-odbc::column-info-to-class-and-args)
....
[61]> (plain-odbc:exec-command *con* "create table bla(a varchar(254),b varchar(255),c varchar(256))")


[62]> (plain-odbc:exec-query *con* "select * from bla")

1. Trace: (PLAIN-ODBC::COLUMN-INFO-TO-CLASS-AND-ARGS '12 '254 '0)
1. Trace: PLAIN-ODBC::COLUMN-INFO-TO-CLASS-AND-ARGS ==> PLAIN-ODBC::STRING-COLUMN, NIL

NIL ;
("a" "b" "c")
]]>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
So string columns which are larger than 255 are treated as <tt>SQL_LONGVARCHAR</tt>.
It is possible to insert strings larger than column size into a 
column. It is possible to retrieve the value via ODBC's <tt>sql_get_data_raw???</tt>. So for Sqlite one should always retrieve variable length values with this method.
Mismatch between raw and text!
<p>
It seems <tt>blob</tt> columns are reported as <tt>SQL_BINARY</tt>.
</p>
